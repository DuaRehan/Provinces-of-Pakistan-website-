      <h2>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah: The Founder of Pakistan</h2>

          <p>Mohammed Ali Jinnah, also called Qaid-i-Azam (Arabic: “Great Leader”), (born December 25, 1876?, Karachi, India [now in Pakistan]—died September 11, 1948, Karachi), Indian Muslim politician, who was the founder and first governor-general (1947–48) of Pakistan.</p>
           <p>Indeed, several were the roles he had played with distinction: at one time or another, he was one of the greatest legal luminaries India had produced during the first half of the century, an `ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity, a great constitutionalist, a distinguished parliamentarian, a top-notch politician, an indefatigable freedom-fighter, a dynamic Muslim leader, a political strategist and, above all one of the great nation-builders of modern times.</p>

<h2 class="history"> Pakistan a Political History </h2>
<hr width="100%" color="#030303" size="4">

     <article class="message">
        <p>When Pakistan became a country on August 14th, 1947, to form the largest Muslim state in the world at that time. The creation of Pakistan was catalyst to the largest demographic movement in recorded history. Nearly seventeen million people-Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs-are reported to have moved in both directions between India and the two wings of Pakistan (the eastern wing is now Bangladesh). Sixty million of the ninety-five million Muslims on the Indian subcontinent became citizens of Pakistan at the time of its creation. Subsequently, thirty-five million Muslims remained inside India making it the largest Muslim minority in a non-Muslim state.</p>
        <p>Scarred from birth, Pakistan's quest for survival has been as compelling as it has been uncertain. Despite the shared religion of its overwhelmingly Muslim population, Pakistan has been engaged in a precarious struggle to define a national identity and evolve a political system for its linguistically diverse population. Pakistan is known to have over twenty languages and over 300 distinct dialects, Urdu and English are the official languages but Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashtu, Baluchi and Seraiki are considered main languages. This diversity has caused chronic regional tensions and successive failures in forming a constitution. Pakistan has also been burdened by full-scale wars with India, a strategically exposed northwestern frontier, and series of economic crises. It has difficulty allocating its scarce economic and natural resources in an equitable manner.</p>

        <h2>The  Art of Pakistan</h2>
        <hr width="100%" color="#030303" size="4" >
        <p>The origin of Pakistani truck art can be traced back to the 1920s when Bedford trucks imported from the UK took to the streets of the country. They are equipped with large wooden arches above the truck bed. The entire cockpit is also equipped with decorative arches, called crowns, with decorative bumpers and wood panels. In the late 1940s, when trucks began to deliver long-distance freight, each company designed a logo so that illiterate people could know who the truck owner was.</p>
        <p>In recent decades, Pakistani truck art-hand-painted floral patterns, poems, and even cartoons of popular characters in trucks, buses and long-distance tuk-tuks has become more and more popular in Western countries.However, in his birthplace, art aroused little interest among art lovers. Over the years, the trucks have been filled with bright flower patterns, cartoons, and even life lessons in the form of poetry. Recently, buses and rickshaws passing through the city centre have also adopted this art form. In addition, artists are now beginning to apply this type to various products, such as bags, shoes, decorative pieces, and furniture. </p>
        <p>Many of these vehicles are art galleries on wheels and decorated with woodcuts and hand-painted designs. There have been many books about intricate carvings and craftsmen’s attention to detail. One point that has been explored is the origin of trade. Little known is that the idea came from the car shops and tea stalls frequented by truck drivers.</p>
